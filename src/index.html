    <span>1) What is Fantasy Cricket?</span><br/><br/>
    <div class="dropdown-content1">
      <p>
        <li>
        Fantasy Cricket is just what the name implies- it is a virtual genre of cricket that hinges on fantasy-based selections of top performers.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
        In it, a player selects a virtual team of 11 players from a total of 30 or so players from two competing teams. He may select them on the basis of their track record, current form, strengths and weaknesses, playing conditions and sometimes even intuition.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
        This online gaming genre also keeps a reserved space for every player’s own understanding and version of cricket. It is so because different fantasy players may perceive a certain real match player differently and the same perception closely affects their team creation.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
        Once a player has created a fantasy team, he is also supposed to mark the captain and vice-captain for it. Each of the players that he has chosen receive points on the basis of their performance on the ground. The captain and vice-captain get additional points for every other player’s performance in the team, besides theirs.
